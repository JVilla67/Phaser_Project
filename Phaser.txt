/*Based on what I've seen on the Phaser framework on GitHub, contributors ask for a request from the original author (Photonstorm) to include their code into the master from a contributor's repo. This can be really helpful for coders that have trouble with their own code and have their program open to anyone for them to work on and, if the code is useful enough for the author and does a pull request, can merge the code onto the master. In the topic of pull requests and merging, this option makes the community organized as well since it pulls works contributed for the original code and, based on the author's response, can either be accepted or denied but either reson is met with feedback on why. To add on to that, conflicts that arise between pull requests can be easily fixed before a code is merged. The repository and projects are organized as well by including new changes to the code in the color green while code that's deleted is in the color red. Git is really helpful for coders to help one another with each others' programs.*/
